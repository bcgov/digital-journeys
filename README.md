<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Docker / docker-compose

### Installation

In order to get started with local development, please follow the steps below

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. Please contact a project dev to get a working one.
2. Run the app
   ```sh
    make run-local
   ```
   be patient, this might take a while the first time :)
3. Once the project is up and running, you can access the web app at localhost:3000.
4. Update the User role env variables in the `.env` file according to the [Formsflow documentation](https://github.com/AOT-Technologies/forms-flow-ai/tree/master/forms-flow-forms#user-content-formsflow-forms-userrole-api) seeing as these are unique per installation. You can use either the `sh` script provided there or the postman collection. **Note:** If you're using the `resourceId_*.sh` script, you need to run it from within the docker container.
5. Restart the application, and you should be good to go!
